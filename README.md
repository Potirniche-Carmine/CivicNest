## About CivicNest

CivicNest is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize property investment decisions by providing comprehensive insights beyond traditional real estate listings. While conventional platforms focus on basic property details, CivicNest delivers detailed neighborhood analytics and economic indicators that directly impact investment potential and long-term value appreciation.

Our interactive map interface uses color-coded markers to visualize properties grouped into **price clusters**, offering an immediate understanding of market segmentation. We go further by incorporating vital economic data, such as:

-   💰 **Price Cluster Analysis**: Understand property values in the context of surrounding comparable homes.
-   📈 **Employment Trend Predictions**: Gauge potential neighborhood economic health via projected employment changes by zipcode.
-   🏠 **Detailed Property Insights**: Access specific details including price, bed/bath counts, cluster averages, and direct links to Zillow listings.
-   🧠 **AI-Generated Market Summaries**: On our dedicated Insights Page, **key market insights for selected clusters are automatically generated by AI** using the underlying property and economic data, providing deeper context.
